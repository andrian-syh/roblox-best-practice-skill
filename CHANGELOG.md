# Changelog

All notable changes to the roblox-best-practices skill are documented here. The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); the skill version tracks `package.json`.

## [1.7.7] - Unreleased

### Added
- `roblox-best-practices/references/false-positives.md` — the "what NOT to flag" catalog: the three-tier severity taxonomy (Blocker / Correctness / Advisory), the four-step confidence gate, category guardrails (hot-loop definition, not-a-leak list, not-a-trust-boundary list, complete-handler note, streaming, typing, deprecated-vs-discouraged), and a regression set of correct snippets that must review clean.
- `roblox-best-practices/references/api-currency.md` — a dated baseline of confirmed engine/Luau APIs (Luau Recap 2025, engine release notes through v728) so the verify-first rule stops re-litigating already-shipped APIs; also lists gated features (new type solver, require-by-string) and newly deprecated APIs.
- `patterns.md`: a centralized **Streaming (StreamingEnabled)** section (`ModelStreamingMode`, `RequestStreamAroundAsync`, tag signals) and **DataStore version history** guidance (`ListVersionsAsync`/`GetVersionAsync`/`ListKeysAsync`).
- `security-monetization.md`: an engine-level **Server Authority** section (Input Action System, attribute replication budget, `GetCameraState`).
- `performance.md`: deeper **Parallel Luau** guidance (`task.synchronize`/`desynchronize`, `SharedTable`).
- `luau-language.md`: a standard-library refresh (`vector` library, `math.map`/`lerp`/`isnan`/`isinf`/`isfinite`, `buffer.readbits`/`writebits`) and expanded user-defined type functions (`keyof`, `issubtypeof`, the `types` library).

### Changed
- **Type safety is now opt-in.** `--!strict` is no longer added on the skill's own initiative; it requires an explicit user request or an existing project convention to match.
- Doc-comment (UDD) rules tightened: one terse technical sentence (≤ ~100 characters), contract-level, English, no em dashes or emoji, and no line-count bloat.
- Review mode reframed around the Blocker/Correctness/Advisory severity vocabulary and the false-positives gate; missing doc comments on trivial private helpers are Advisory, not violations.
- Reference Routing table extended with `false-positives.md` and `api-currency.md`; streaming, Server Authority, and DataStore versioning surfaced in existing rows.

### Fixed
- `Instance.new(class, parent)` recategorized from "deprecated" to a discouraged performance choice (Advisory), correcting a mislabel that produced false findings.
- Added the `Player:GetRankInGroupAsync`/`GetRoleInGroupAsync` -> `GroupService:GetRolesInGroupAsync` deprecation.
